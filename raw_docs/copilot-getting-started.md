The following example uses JavaScript, however other languages will work similarly. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.
Open Visual Studio Code.
In Visual Studio Code, create a new JavaScript (
*.js
) file.
In the JavaScript file, type the following function header.
JavaScript
function calculateDaysBetweenDates(begin, end) {
function
