Introduction
This guide describes how to use Copilot Chat to ask questions about software development in your IDE. You can ask general questions about software development, or specific questions about the code in your project. For more information, see
About GitHub Copilot Chat
.
Prerequisites
Access to GitHub Copilot
. See
What is GitHub Copilot?
.
Latest version of Visual Studio Code
. See the
Visual Studio Code download page
.
Sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code
. If you experience authentication issues, see
Troubleshooting common issues with GitHub Copilot
.
If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization, you won't be able to use GitHub Copilot Chat if your organization owner has disabled chat. See
Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization
.
Submitting prompts
You can ask Copilot Chat to give you code suggestions, explain code, generate unit tests, and suggest code fixes.
To open the chat view, click the
icon in the title bar of Visual Studio Code. If the
icon is not displayed, right-click the title bar and make sure that
Command Center
is selected.
Enter a prompt in the prompt box, or click one of the suggested prompts. For an introduction to the kinds of prompts you can use, see
Getting started with prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat
.
Evaluate Copilot's response, and make a follow-up request if needed.
The response may contain text, code blocks, buttons, images, URIs, and file trees. The response often includes interactive elements. For example, the response may include a menu to insert a code block, or a button to invoke a Visual Studio Code command.
To see the files that Copilot Chat used to generate the response, select the
Used
n
references
dropdown at the top of the response. The references may include a link to a custom instructions file for your repository. This file contains additional information that is automatically added to all of your chat questions to improve the quality of the responses. For more information, see
Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot
.
Using keywords in your prompt
You can use special keywords to help Copilot understand your prompt. For examples, see
Getting started with prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat
.
Chat participants
Chat participants are like domain experts who have a specialty that they can help you with.
Copilot Chat can infer relevant chat participants based on your natural language prompt, improving discovery of advanced capabilities without you having to explicitly specify the participant you want to use in your prompt.
Note
Automatic inference for chat participants is currently in public preview and is subject to change.
Alternatively, you can manually specify a chat participant to scope your prompt to a specific domain. To do this, type
@
in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat participant name.
For a list of available chat participants, type
@
in the chat prompt box. See also
GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet
or
Chat participants
in the Visual Studio Code documentation.
Copilot Extensions chat participants
You can also install Copilot Extensions that provide chat participants. You can install these extensions from
GitHub Marketplace
and from
Visual Studio Code Marketplace
. For information about extensions from GitHub Marketplace that provide chat participants, see
Using extensions to integrate external tools with GitHub Copilot Chat
.
Slash commands
Use slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To use a slash command, type
/
in the chat prompt box, followed by a command.
To see all available slash commands, type
/
in the chat prompt box. See also
GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet
or
Slash commands
in the Visual Studio Code documentation.
Chat variables
Use chat variables to include specific context in your prompt. To use a chat variable, type
#
in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat variable.
To see all available chat variables, type
#
in the chat prompt box. See also
GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet
or
Chat variables
in the Visual Studio Code documentation.
Using GitHub skills for Copilot
Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat, include
@github
in your question.
When you add
@github
to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:
Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example,
@github Search the web to find the latest GPT model from OpenAI.
To specifically invoke a web search you can include the
#web
variable in your question. For example,
@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?
You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot:
@github What skills are available?
AI models for Copilot Chat
You can change the model Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. Options include premium models with advanced capabilities.  See
Changing the AI model for GitHub Copilot Chat
.
Additional ways to access Copilot Chat
In addition to submitting prompts through the chat view, you can submit prompts in other ways:
Quick chat:
To open the quick chat dropdown, enter
⇧
+
⌥

See
inline chat
,
quick chat
, and
chat smart actions
in the Visual Studio Code documentation for more details.
Copilot Edits
Use Copilot Edits to make changes across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt. Copilot Edits has the following modes:
Edit mode
lets Copilot make controlled edits to multiple files.
Agent mode
lets Copilot autonomously accomplish a set task.
Edit mode
Edit mode is only available in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs.
Use edit mode when you want more granular control over the edits that Copilot proposes. In edit mode, you choose which files Copilot can make changes to, provide context to Copilot with each iteration, and decide whether or not to accept the suggested edits after each turn.
Edit mode is best suited to use cases where:
You want to make a quick, specific update to a defined set of files.
You want full control over the number of LLM requests Copilot uses.
Using edit mode
To start an edit session, select
Open Chat
from the Copilot Chat menu.
At the bottom of the chat panel, select
Edit
from the mode dropdown.
Optionally, add relevant files to the
working set
to indicate to GitHub Copilot which files you want to work on.
Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot Edits determines which files in your
working set
to change and adds a short description of the change.
Review the changes and
Apply
or
Discard
the edits for each file.
For more detailed instructions, see
Copilot Edits
in the Visual Studio Code documentation.
Agent mode
Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.
Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:
Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.
Using agent mode
To start an edit session, select
Open Chat
from the Copilot Chat menu.
At the bottom of the chat panel, select
Agent
from the mode dropdown.
Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.
You can also directly
open agent mode in VS Code
.
For more information, see
Copilot Edits
in the Visual Studio Code documentation.
When you use Copilot agent mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using the included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. Copilot may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do
not
count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.
The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See
Requests in GitHub Copilot
.
Using images in Copilot Chat
Note
If you're using a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the organization or enterprise that provides your plan must enable the
Editor preview features
setting. See
Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization
or
Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your enterprise
.
You can attach images to your chat prompts and then ask Copilot about the images. For example, you can attach:
A screenshot of a code snippet and ask Copilot to explain the code.
A mockup of the user interface for an application and ask Copilot to generate the code.
A flowchart and ask Copilot to describe the processes shown in the image.
A screenshot of a web page and ask Copilot to generate HTML for a similar page.
Note
The following types of image file are supported: JPEG (
.jpg
,
.jpeg
), PNG (
.png
), GIF (
.gif
), or WEBP (
.webp
).
Attaching images to your chat prompt
If you see the AI model picker at the bottom right of the chat view, select one of the models that supports adding images to prompts:
GPT-4.1 (the default that's used if you don't see a model picker)
Claude Sonnet 3.5
Claude Sonnet 3.7
Gemini 2.0 Flash
Gemini 2.5 Pro
Do one of the following:
Copy an image and paste it into the chat view.
Drag and drop one or more image file from your operating system's file explorer—or from the Explorer in VS Code—into the chat view.
Right-click an image file in the VS Code Explorer and click
Copilot
then
Add File to Chat
.
Type your prompt into the chat view to accompany the image. For example,
explain this diagram
,
describe each of these images in detail
,
what does this error message mean
.

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.
Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:
Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.
Using agent mode
To open the chat view, click
Copilot
in the menu bar, then click
Open Chat
.
At the bottom of the chat panel, select
Agent
from the mode dropdown.
Optionally, add relevant files to the
working set
view to indicate to Copilot which files you want to work on.
Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.
When you use Copilot agent mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using the included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. Copilot may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do
not
count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.
The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See
Requests in GitHub Copilot
.
File references
By default, Copilot Chat will reference the file that you have open or the code that you have selected. To attach a specific file as reference, click
in the chat prompt box.
Chat management
You can open a conversation thread for each Xcode IDE to keep discussions organized across different contexts. You can also revisit previous conversations and reference past suggestions through the chat history.
Sharing feedback
To indicate whether a response was helpful, use
