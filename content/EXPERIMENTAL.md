*Status: WIP*

Exploring LLM-powered automation in platform-based software collaboration


#### [GitHub Copilot Radar](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-radar/)
*Status: WIP*

GitHub Copilot Radar is a code navigation tool that shows developers the most relevant line to their position in the code. Itâs jump-to-definition on (neural) steroids.


#### [Discovery Agent](https://githubnext.com/projects/discovery-agent/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Agentic Setup, Build, and Testing of Repositories.


#### [Incremental CodeQL](https://githubnext.com/projects/incremental-codeql/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Faster feedback about security vulnerabilities on your PRs.


#### [Learning Sandbox](https://githubnext.com/projects/learning-sandbox/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Can we make it easy and fun to learn as we build? Weâre exploring ways to create personalized, interactive learning environments that integrate into your daily workflow.


#### [Mosaic](https://githubnext.com/projects/mosaic/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Can we derive personalized design systems from sources of inspiration?


#### [Realtime GitHub](https://githubnext.com/projects/rtgh/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Multiplayer collaboration for your whole repo.


#### [SpecLang](https://githubnext.com/projects/speclang/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Can we develop software entirely in natural language, and an AI-powered toolchain manage the implementation?


#### [Vitale](https://githubnext.com/projects/vitale/)
*Status: Research prototype*

Live notebooks in VS Code for JavaScript/TypeScript, web development, and AI experimentation

## Graduated to Product

### Experiments That Became Features

#### [Copilot Completions in the CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-completions-cli/)
*Now a GitHub product*

Ever having trouble remembering that shell command or this obscure flag? Don't worry: we're building GitHub Copilot assistance right into your terminal


#### [Copilot for Docs](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/)
*Now a GitHub product*

How would it feel to have an expert on hand at all times? We built a tool that uses relevant information from a projectâs documentation to answer questions or explain concepts.


#### [Copilot for Pull Requests](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/)
*Now a GitHub product*

Pull requests are a central part of the GitHub user experience. Copilot for PRs brings the power of Copilot to the PR experience, to help you write better PR descriptions, and to help your team review and merge PRs faster.


#### [Copilot Next Edit Suggestions](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-next-edit-suggestions/)
*Now a GitHub product*

Can we improve Copilot code completion by suggesting the next logical change, wherever it is in your project?


#### [Flat Data](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data/)
*Now a GitHub product*

Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub, offering a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them.


#### [GitHub Spark](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark/)
*Now a GitHub product*

Can we enable anyone to create or adapt software for themselves, using AI and a fully-managed runtime?


#### [React Webview UI Toolkit for VS Code](https://githubnext.com/projects/react-webview-ui-toolkit/)
*Now a GitHub product*

An ongoing collaboration with Microsoft to bring React to their library Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
