## Active Experiments

### [GitHub Copilot Radar](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-radar/) (Status: WIP)

GitHub Copilot Radar is a code navigation tool that shows developers the most relevant line to their position in the code. It's jump-to-definition on (neural) steroids.

### [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/) (Status: WIP)

Exploring LLM-powered automation in platform-based software collaboration

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/)

### [Discovery Agent](https://githubnext.com/projects/discovery-agent/) (Status: Research prototype)

Agentic Setup, Build, and Testing of Repositories.

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/discovery-agent/)

### [Agentic Workflows](https://githubnext.com/projects/agentic-workflows/) (Status: Research prototype)

Towards Natural-Language Programming for GitHub Actions

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/agentic-workflows/)

### [Learning Sandbox](https://githubnext.com/projects/learning-sandbox/) (Status: Research prototype)

Can we make it easy and fun to learn as we build? We're exploring ways to create personalized, interactive learning environments that integrate into your daily workflow.

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/learning-sandbox/)

### [SpecLang](https://githubnext.com/projects/speclang/) (Status: Research prototype)

Can we develop software entirely in natural language, and an AI-powered toolchain manage the implementation?

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/speclang/)

### [Incremental CodeQL](https://githubnext.com/projects/incremental-codeql/) (Status: Research prototype)

Faster feedback about security vulnerabilities on your PRs.

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/incremental-codeql/)

### [Mosaic](https://githubnext.com/projects/mosaic/) (Status: Research prototype)

Can we derive personalized design systems from sources of inspiration?

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/mosaic/)

### [Realtime GitHub](https://githubnext.com/projects/rtgh/) (Status: Research prototype)

Multiplayer collaboration for your whole repo.

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/rtgh/)

### [Vitale](https://githubnext.com/projects/vitale/) (Status: Research prototype)

Live notebooks in VS Code for JavaScript/TypeScript, web development, and AI experimentation

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/vitale/)

### [Code Atlas](https://githubnext.com/projects/code-atlas/) (Status: Napkin sketch)

How can we make LLM responses more robust and easier to understand by combining their fluid reasoning with rigid structure?

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/code-atlas/)

### [Project Copernicus](https://githubnext.com/projects/copernicus/) (Status: Napkin sketch)

Exploring LLM-powered navigation for your codebase

→ [Explore this experiment](https://githubnext.com/projects/copernicus/)

### [Collaborative Workspaces](https://githubnext.com/projects/workspaces/) (Status: Napkin sketch)

As we increasingly work together remotely, how might we unify our workflows to enable remote collaboration for developers? GitHub Next explores what "working together" means, beyond multiple cursors and a shared code editor.
