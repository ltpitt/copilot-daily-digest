### Top 5 Updates

#### 1. [The Dependabot Proxy is now open source with an MIT license](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-03-the-dependabot-proxy-is-now-open-source-with-an-mit-license)
*Feb 3, 2026*

The Dependabot Proxy is now available as open source under the MIT license. What's new
You can now:

Review the source code to see how authentication works for various package managers and Git servers. Submit bug fixes or add support for new package ecosystems.

#### 2. [How to maximize GitHub Copilot’s agentic capabilities](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-maximize-github-copilots-agentic-capabilities/)
*Feb 2, 2026*

Modern engineering work rarely lives in a single file. Real systems evolve across years of incrementally layered decisions—some good, some accidental. A single feature request ("Add tagging to notes," "Refactor the validation layer," "Support a new consumer on our API") often touches controllers, domain models, repositories, migrations, tests, documentation, and deployment strategy.

#### 3. [arm64 standard runners are now available in private repositories](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-01-29-arm64-standard-runners-are-now-available-in-private-repositories)
*Jan 29, 2026*

Linux and Windows arm64 standard GitHub-hosted runners are now supported in private repositories. You can now use these free-tier eligible arm64 runners in all repositories, letting you take advantage of the performance benefits of arm64 processors and run native multi-architecture builds without the overhead of virtualization or emulation.

#### 4. [Closing down notice of legacy Copilot metrics APIs](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-01-29-closing-down-notice-of-legacy-copilot-metrics-apis)
*Jan 29, 2026*

We are closing down three legacy Copilot metrics APIs as part of our transition to newer, more comprehensive usage metrics endpoints. Support for these APIs will be limited, and no new features will be developed. The User-level Feature Engagement Metrics API and Direct Data Access API will sunset on March 2nd, 2026.

#### 5. [CodeQL 2.24.0 adds Swift 6.2 and .NET 10 support, and improves file handling for minified JavaScript](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-01-29-codeql-2-24-0-adds-swift-6-2-support-net-10-compatibility-and-file-handling-for-minified-javascript)
*Jan 29, 2026*

CodeQL is the static analysis engine behind GitHub code scanning, which finds and remediates security issues in your code. We've recently released CodeQL 2.24.0, which adds support for new language versions, expands framework coverage, and improves query accuracy across multiple languages.
