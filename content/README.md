## Spotlight: Improved Pull Request Review Experience

**Enhanced "Files Changed" page now default for all users!**

The improved pull request "Files changed" experience has rolled out to all users as the default experience. This update brings significant improvements to code review workflows.

**Key improvements**:
- **Comment on any line**: Now comment on any line of a changed file, not just surrounding changes
- **View description inline**: See PR description from Overview panel without switching pages
- **Enhanced file tree**: Resizable with indicators for comments, errors, and warnings
- **Draft comments**: Comments saved locally—no loss on accidental browser close
- **Better performance**: Fewer page reloads for large PRs with experimental virtualization mode
- **Accessibility**: Improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support
