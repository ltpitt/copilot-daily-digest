# Daily Copilot Documentation Workflow

This workflow has been fixed and should now run successfully. The issues resolved include:

- Missing requirements.txt file
- Missing scraper script 
- Invalid workflow action reference
- Missing directories and permissions

The workflow now:
1. Sets up Python environment
2. Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Runs the scraper to fetch Copilot docs (with fallback content)
4. Commits any changes to raw_docs/
5. Provides placeholder for Copilot agent integration
