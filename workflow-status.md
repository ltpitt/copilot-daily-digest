# Daily Copilot Documentation Workflow

This workflow has been **FIXED** and should now run successfully. The issues resolved include:

## Previous Issues Fixed:
- ❌ Missing requirements.txt file → ✅ Fixed
- ❌ Missing scraper script → ✅ Fixed  
- ❌ Invalid workflow action reference → ✅ **MAJOR FIX**
- ❌ Missing directories and permissions → ✅ Fixed
- ❌ Git commit failures when no changes → ✅ **NEW FIX**
- ❌ Incorrect branch targeting → ✅ **NEW FIX**

## Recent Major Fixes (2025-09-18):
1. **Fixed Invalid Action Reference**: Replaced `github/copilot-coding-agent/.github/workflows/agent.yml@main` with proper GitHub Script action
2. **Added Required Permissions**: Added `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`
3. **Improved Git Handling**: Added conditional logic to avoid commit failures when no changes exist
4. **Enhanced Copilot Integration**: Creates GitHub issues that trigger Copilot agent instead of invalid action reference
5. **Better Branch Targeting**: Changed from `'**'` to `main` branch for more controlled execution

## Current Workflow:
1. ✅ Sets up Python environment (Python 3.11)
2. ✅ Installs dependencies from requirements.txt (requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml)
3. ✅ Runs the scraper to fetch Copilot docs (with fallback content)
4. ✅ Commits any changes to raw_docs/ (only if changes exist)
5. ✅ Creates GitHub issue for Copilot agent to process documentation

## Triggers:
- ⏰ Daily at 6 AM UTC (cron schedule)
- 🔄 Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
- 📝 Push to main branch
