> Are AI news causing you a headache? Can't keep up with Copilot updates? If we only had an Agent to keep up with Agents...

**Good news:** We do! This repository automatically aggregates GitHub Copilot content from official sources and organizes it daily using the Copilot Coding Agent itself.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Weekly scraping** - Good old deterministic data fetching from official sources (docs, blog, YouTube, GitHub Next) on Friday morning, when the GitHub release cycle for the week is complete
2. **Change detection** - Smart diffing identifies what's actually new since yesterday
3. **AI generation** - Copilot Coding Agent organizes everything into digestible content
4. **PR creation** - Automated pull request ready for review and merge

All on autopilot, using Copilot to track... Copilot. Meta? Perhaps. Useful? Absolutely.
