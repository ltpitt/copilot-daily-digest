---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/scraper/generate_videos.py` ✅
**Major improvements to video page generation logic**

#### Changes Made:

##### A. Category Reorganization
- **Merged overlapping categories**: Combined "Features" and "Updates" into "Features & Updates"
- **Reordered categories** for better logical flow:
  - Getting Started (beginners)
  - Features & Updates (new capabilities)
  - Tutorials (learning resources)
  - Agents (advanced topics)
  - Extensions (integrations)
  - Other (catch-all)

##### B. Removed Duplication
- Added `recent_video_ids` tracking to identify which videos are recent
- Modified `format_video_entry()` to accept `is_recent` parameter
- Recent videos shown in "What's New This Week" with full metadata
- Same videos in category sections marked with 🆕 badge instead of being duplicated

##### C. Streamlined Metadata
- Added `metadata_level` parameter to `format_video_entry()`:
  - `"full"`: Shows Published, Duration, Views, Channel (for "What's New" section)
  - `"minimal"`: Shows only Published and Duration (for category sections)
- Reduces visual clutter while preserving essential information

##### D. Featured Videos Infrastructure
- Added `FEATURED_VIDEO_IDS` constant for manual curation
- Created "⭐ Featured Videos" section that appears when IDs are configured
- Automatically hidden when list is empty
- Allows highlighting evergreen high-value content

##### E. Statistics Callout Box
- Moved statistics from bottom section to compact callout at top
- Markdown blockquote format with emoji bullets
- Shows: total videos, new this week, category breakdown
- More scannable and less repetitive

##### F. Better Category Descriptions
- Added "When to watch" guidance to each category
- Examples:
  - **Getting Started**: "When to watch: You're exploring Copilot for the first time..."
  - **Agents**: "When to watch: You're interested in multi-file editing, autonomous task completion..."
- Appears in both "Browse by Topic" overview and individual category sections
- Helps users quickly identify relevant content

##### G. Navigation Improvements
- Renamed "Table of Contents" → "Quick Navigation"
- Renamed "Browse by Category" → "Browse by Topic"
- Empty categories automatically hidden from TOC and page
- Better visual hierarchy with section headers

### 2. `/scraper/README_GENERATE_VIDEOS.md` ✅
**Updated documentation to reflect new features**

#### Changes Made:
- Updated feature list to include new capabilities
- Added "Featured Videos" section explaining manual curation
- Updated category list (merged Features + Updates)
- Expanded "Expected Output" section
- Updated "Output Format" section with new structure
- Updated `format_video_entry()` function signature documentation
- Added maintenance instructions for curating featured videos

### 3. `/docs/videos-md-improvements.md` ✅ (NEW)
**Comprehensive before/after comparison document**

Created detailed guide showing:
- Side-by-side before/after examples
- Visual demonstrations of all improvements
- Impact explanation for each change
- Testing instructions
- Key benefits summary

### 4. `/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (CREATED IN ROOT - TO BE DELETED)
