# Task: Synthesize GitHub Copilot Content for Engineers

## Mission
**Help engineers stay current with GitHub Copilot through modular, topic-focused documentation.**

Engineers need:
- ✅ **Modularity** - Each topic in its own file
- ✅ **Scannability** - Quick navigation to relevant sections  
- ✅ **Freshness** - Latest updates clearly separated from historical content
- ✅ **Actionability** - Concrete examples and working links

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Data Scraping Phase (ALWAYS REQUIRED FIRST)

**CRITICAL**: Before synthesizing any content, you **MUST** run the scrapers to fetch fresh data.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Scrapers (in order)
```bash
# 1. Fetch GitHub Copilot documentation (14+ files)
python3 scraper/fetch_docs.py

# 2. Fetch GitHub Blog posts (Copilot-related articles)
python3 scraper/fetch_blog.py

# 3. Detect changes since last update
python3 scraper/detect_changes.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Data
Before proceeding to content synthesis, verify:
- ✅ `data/docs/` contains 14+ .md files (NOT just .gitkeep)
- ✅ `data/metadata.json` is updated with latest timestamps
- ✅ `data/changes-summary.json` shows detected changes

**If any of these checks fail, STOP and report the error. DO NOT proceed with content synthesis.**

### Why This Matters
- **Without fresh docs**: Content will be based on stale metadata only
- **Without blog posts**: Best practices and recent features will be missing
- **Without change detection**: WHATS-NEW.md will be inaccurate

**This scraping phase is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Always run it first.**

## Content Architecture: Modular Topic-Based Structure

We generate **8 focused content files** (+ 1 auto-generated), each serving a specific purpose:

```
content/
├── README.md          # Navigation hub (50-100 lines max)
├── GETTING-STARTED.md # Quick start + best practices  
├── STARTER-KIT.md     # Deep onboarding: philosophy, workflow, training
├── WHATS-NEW.md       # Latest updates (last 30 days)
├── VIDEOS.md          # Video library (AUTO-GENERATED by generate_videos.py)
├── TRAININGS.md       # Courses & certifications
├── CHANGELOG.md       # Complete historical timeline
├── COMMANDS.md        # Slash commands + shortcuts
└── REFERENCE.md       # Complete docs index
```

**Key Principles**: 
- Each file is **self-contained** and **topic-focused**. No mixing of concerns.
- **CRITICAL**: All content files use **UPPERCASE** naming (e.g., TRAININGS.md, not trainings.md)

---

## Data Sources
- `data/docs/` - Official GitHub documentation (14 Markdown files)
- `data/blog/` - GitHub Blog posts (JSON files with full HTML content)
- `data/videos/` - YouTube videos from GitHub channel (JSON files)
- `data/trainings/` - Training courses and certifications (JSON files)
- `data/changes-summary.json` - What changed since last scrape (with diff summaries)
- `data/metadata.json` - Version history and timestamps

---

## File 1: content/README.md - Navigation Hub

**Purpose**: Central index linking to all other files  
**Max Length**: 50-100 lines  
**Style**: Clean, minimal, navigation-focused

**Max Length**: 200-300 lines  
**Style**: Tutorial format with concrete examples

### Structure
```markdown
# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

> Your 5-minute guide to productive AI pair programming

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Copilot in Your IDE

**VS Code**:
```bash
# Install extension
code --install-extension GitHub.copilot
```

**JetBrains**: Install from Plugins marketplace  
**Visual Studio**: Version 17.14+ includes built-in support  
**Xcode/Eclipse**: Available for Pro/Pro+ subscribers

### 2. Try Your First Prompt

Open any file and type a comment:
```javascript
// Create a function that validates email addresses with regex
```

Press `Enter` - Copilot suggests the implementation.

### 3. Use Chat for Complex Tasks

Press `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+I` (Mac):
```
Explain this codebase structure and list any failing tests
```

### 4. Enable Agent Mode (Optional)

For autonomous multi-step tasks:
- VS Code: Settings → enable "Copilot > Agent Mode"
- Ask: "Add Redis caching to userSessionService with 30s TTL"
- Copilot determines files, makes changes, opens a PR

## 💡 Best Practices

[Extract 5-7 actionable tips from recent blog posts]

### Write Context-Rich Prompts
❌ **Don't**: "Add caching"  
✅ **Do**: "Add Redis caching to userSessionService with 30s TTL to reduce DB hits >1000/min"

## AI Synthesis Guidelines

### Modularity is Key
- ❌ Don't: Mix topics in one file (e.g., videos + commands + changelog in README.md)
- ✅ Do: Each topic gets its own file with clear boundaries

### Keep Navigation Simple
- ❌ Don't: Make users scroll through long README.md to find what they need
- ✅ Do: README.md is a clean hub with links to topic-specific files

### Respect File Purposes
- README.md = Navigation hub (50-100 lines max)
- GETTING-STARTED.md = Tutorial + best practices (200-300 lines)
- STARTER-KIT.md = Deep onboarding guide (300-400 lines)
- WHATS-NEW.md = Recent updates only (auto-expires old content)
- VIDEOS.md = Auto-generated, DO NOT touch
- TRAININGS.md = Course catalog (400-500 lines)
- CHANGELOG.md = Complete history (unlimited, grows over time)
- COMMANDS.md = Quick reference tables (200-300 lines)
- REFERENCE.md = Doc index with links (100-200 lines)

### Quality Over Quantity
- Brief, actionable, with concrete examples
- Every item links to source
- No marketing fluff, assume technical audience

---

## Format Guidelines
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively (📰 🎥 ✨ 📚)
- Keep content scannable with clear headers and lists
- Link to original sources
- Date all content updates
- Maintain consistent formatting across files

### Anchor Link Rules (CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE)

**GitHub strips emojis from anchor IDs. Anchor links with emojis WILL BREAK.**

**THE ONLY RULE: DO NOT USE EMOJIS IN SECTION HEADINGS THAT ARE LINK TARGETS**

**✅ CORRECT - Clean headings without emojis:**
```markdown
## Official GitHub Courses
[Link to section](#official-github-courses)  <!-- ✅ Works perfectly -->
```

**❌ WRONG - Emojis in headings that are link targets:**
```markdown
## 🎓 Official GitHub Courses  <!-- ❌ BROKEN - emoji in heading -->
[Link to section](#official-github-courses)  <!-- Link breaks because GitHub can't match -->
[Link to section](#🎓-official-github-courses)  <!-- Also broken -->
```

**How GitHub converts headings to anchors:**
1. Convert to lowercase
2. **Remove ALL emojis and special characters** (keep only: letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores)
3. Replace spaces with hyphens
4. Strip leading/trailing hyphens

**Exception: Navigation headers that are NOT link targets can use emojis:**
```markdown
## 📋 Quick Navigation  <!-- ✅ OK - No links point TO this heading -->
- [Official Courses](#official-github-courses)
- [Microsoft Learn](#microsoft-learn-modules)

## Official GitHub Courses  <!-- Clean heading - links point HERE -->
[content...]

## Microsoft Learn Modules  <!-- Clean heading - links point HERE -->
[content...]
```

**Validation (MANDATORY - Quality Gate):**
After generating or editing ANY content files, you MUST run link validation:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_links.py
```

This script validates:
- ✅ Internal file links work
- ✅ Anchor links match actual headings
- ✅ External URLs return HTTP 200
- ⚠️  **Emojis in headings that are link targets** (CRITICAL RULE)

**The script MUST pass with zero errors before work is considered complete.**

If validation fails:
1. Fix all broken links immediately
2. Remove emojis from any headings that are link targets
3. Re-run validation until it passes
4. Verify links work on GitHub (not just VS Code preview)
